# SalonHub

## Concept:
- SalonHub is a personal care booking platform where salons list their services and customers can book them for a future time slot.

## Tech:
- SalonHub is a cross-platform application built using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and optimized for [Android](https://developer.android.com/) and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/).
- As an architecture [BLOC (Business Logic Component)](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) is used for UI and logic separation.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used for authentication and for storing data and images.
- For verification of each case in BLOC/Cubit, it is safeguarded with [Unit Test](https://github.com/areebmomin/Salon-Hub-in-Flutter/tree/main/test).
